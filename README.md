# EDA & Machine Learning exercises

- ## ❤️‍🔥 OKcupid
    - Dataset : [OKcupid Profiles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles?datasetId=875173&sortBy=voteCount)
    - Mini EDA exercise : [OKcupid EDA](https://github.com/risa1796/EDA-exercises/blob/main/OKCupid_Profiles_EDA-2.ipynb)
    - User segmentation : [OKcupid Customer segmentation](https://github.com/risa1796/EDA-ML-exercises/blob/main/OKCupid_UserSegmentation_ClusteringAlgorithms2.ipynb)
       - Lessons learned : The concept of clustering is more or less clear enough to apply. However, I am still having difficulties in understanding how to interpret the result of clustering algorithms 🤷🏻‍♀️ Higher number of featrues seems to make more difficult to cluster datapoints and visualize the result. 
    

- ## 🚴🏻‍♂️ Stolen bicycle report in Berlin Germany
    - Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/staefff/stolen-bike-report-berlin
    - EDA exercise: [Berlin stolen bicycle report](https://github.com/risa1796/EDA-ML-exercises/blob/main/Stolen_Bike_Report_in_Berlin.ipynb)
    - Lessons learned: shame that I couldnt do forecasting because there were many missing dates within the period. One year dataset will lead to overfitting with high possibility. 
    - Tableau visualization:

- ## 🐺 Woes Club Churn Prediction with Pycaret
    - Dataset: [Woes Club](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varshapandey/assignment-data)
    - References: [Pycaret](https://www.kaggle.com/code/frtgnn/pycaret-introduction-classification-regression/notebook)
    - [Churn Prediction Model](https://github.com/risa1796/EDA-ML-exercises/blob/main/woes_club_churn_prediction_withPycaret.ipynb)
    - Lesson learned: Pycaret needs certain environment settings. It is definitely a useful package to easily get the best model for dataset. But I would not totally rely on the package. Always try out different approaches for data preprocessing and model building.
